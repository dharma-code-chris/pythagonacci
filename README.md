Produces a Fibonacci-Pythagorean tree that produces all the primitive
pythagorean triples (if you process the nodes further) and (given infinite
computational capacity) all rational values in the range 0 < v < 1 (if you
take the left and the right pairs in the nodes as fractions).

See the YouTube video from Mathologer below for background.
